Objectives:
• Build a program that will allow a user, the pilot, to enter a number.
• If the number is above 100 or less than 0, keep asking.
• Clear the screen once the program has collected a good number.
• Ask a second user, the hunter, to guess numbers.
• Indicate whether the user guessed too high, too low, or guessed right.
• Loop until they get it right, then end the program.
